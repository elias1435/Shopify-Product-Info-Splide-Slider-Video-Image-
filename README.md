# Shopify Product Info Splide Slider (Video + Image)

A drop-in Shopify OS 2.0 **product block + snippet** that adds a Splide-powered media slider **under the product information**. Each slide can be a **video (uploaded or URL)** with a **30Ã—30 white play overlay**, or a **fallback image** cropped nicely to a fixed height. Fully configurable from the Theme Editorâ€”no app required.
